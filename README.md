# Mario-Game

The first program I ever created was an odd Mario game that I made when I was 12 years old

Some say this game has been so horribly created that it's unplayable, those people have obviously played it :)

To start the game, choose one of the Mario executables or run the Menu.exe for the main menu

Instructions: Arrow Keys for movement. Spacebar to jump and the Enter Key for everything else
