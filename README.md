# Mario-Game

The first program I ever created was an odd Mario game that I created when I was 12...it has a quite a lot of problems but it remains my favorite project to date. 
Some say this game is unbeatable and horribly coded, they coudln't be even more correct :)

To start the game, choose one of the Mario executables or run the Menu.exe for the main menu
